# Flower-Shop-Ordering-Platform
Capstone project by BSCS-2 F3: Group 4 JAVAWookez (Alcoseba, Aloyon, Ares, Encabo, &amp; Quibuyen)

Project Description:
  The proposed system is a Flower Shop Ordering Platform designed to streamline the process of buying flowers, whether through premade arrangements or fully customized bouquets. The goal of the system is to give users a convenient, interactive, and flexible way to create or choose flower arrangements according to their preferences. By guiding users step-by-step through the selection process, the system ensures a smooth ordering experience from choosing flowers all the way to checkout and delivery.
The system begins by presenting users with two primary options: Premade Bouquets or Per Stem Purchase. If the user chooses to purchase per stem, they will be directed to a complete list of available flowers. Each flower type will display essential details such as its name, color, and price per stem. Users can then customize the number of stems they wish to buy using “+” and “–” controls. Once they finalize their selections, they will be taken to the checkout page. At checkout, users may add additional options—such as wrappers, ribbons, message cards, or accessories—as well as select their preferred mode of payment and delivery method (delivery or pickup).
On the other hand, if the user chooses the Bouquet option, they will be redirected to a page that allows them to select the bouquet size. The system offers three standard sizes: Small (3 flowers), Medium (6 flowers), and Large (12 flowers). After choosing a size, the user will see two main paths: selecting from a collection of Ready-Made Bouquets or choosing the Custom Bouquet option. For ready-made bouquets, users simply click on their desired arrangement and proceed directly to checkout.
If the user selects the Custom Bouquet option, the system will guide them through building their bouquet from scratch. A list of available flower types will be displayed, along with controls for adding (“+”) or removing (“–”) stems. The system actively monitors the flower count to ensure that the total number of stems matches the required maximum for the chosen size (3, 6, or 12). Users will not be allowed to continue until they have fully completed the bouquet by meeting the required number of stems. Once the bouquet is complete, the user can proceed to the checkout page, where they will once again choose their payment method and delivery mode.
Overall, this system focuses on user customization, smooth navigation, and clear order flow, making it easy for customers to tailor their floral purchases according to their needs. It combines convenience, creativity, and structured purchasing options, giving users full control over whether they want a simple premade bouquet or a personalized arrangement built from individual flower stems.
